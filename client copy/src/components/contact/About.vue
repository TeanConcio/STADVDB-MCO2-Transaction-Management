                    <br><br>
                    Mission Ministries Philippines serves community and the poorest by partnering with churches, Non Government Organizations, community based groups and authorized individuals in setting up, or enriching, an existing Early Childhood Development Program.
                    <br><br>
                    We believe education is a way out of poverty. Our experience has proven that in order to eradicate the cycle of poverty, many of the poorest children inherit – can only be accomplished by initiating better education choices for children at an early age. This is even more prevalant in the slum communities we serve.
                    <br><br>
                    With a commitment to the 4/14 Window Movement (children ages 4 to 14) we also implement initiatives that target children most receptive to receiving the Gospel message of Christ.
